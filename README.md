## Description of the Project (300 words)

As COVID-19 continues to become a greater problem, the need for online school has become more and more prominent. However, for the first 2 years, video conferencing platforms such as zoom have proved to provide little to no engagement leading to students' attentive levels constantly decreasing and online learning becoming less effective. However, spat!al aims to elevate the virtual classroom experience by creating a realistic environment that creates the exact ambiance of the inside of a real classroom. This is through our eye-tracking and spatial audio apps that contribute in enhancing student-teacher connections, more realistic engagement and health benefits for instructors and students which overall helps improve the quality of online education. The eye-tracking app enables instructors to monitor the attentiveness of the class and use the overall attentiveness score to tailor their teaching methods and alter curriculums throughout the year. For example, through these analytics, teachers would be able to easily identify weak spots throughout the lectures where the attentive rate is significantly low. Furthermore, the spatial audio app would allow students to hear other neighbors and teacher voices around the class just like they would in a real classroom or lecture theatre. For example, if a student were in the middle of the class their sound would be heard from the backsides and the front.
